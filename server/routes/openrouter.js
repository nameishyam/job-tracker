Provide actionable advice, next steps, and if applicable, congratulations or motivation. Address the user directly using "you" (e.g., "you have done this," "my advice to you is..."). Do not conclude with open-ended questions inviting further conversation. Format your response in markdown. Lastly consolidate it into a 2 to 3 paragraphs content without any bolds and other syntaxes. Ensure the response is clear, concise, and free of grammatical errors. No need to give any headings and side headings in the response. just start with the content. no need to tell what you are going to do, just do it.`;
